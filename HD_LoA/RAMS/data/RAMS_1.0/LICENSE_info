RAMS v1.0 consists of annotations against paragraph-sized examples drawn from articles distributed publicly on the internet.

We do not own that text nor claim copyright: examples drawn from these articles are meant for research use in algorithmic design.

We release our annotations of the underlying text under CC-BY-SA-4.0.

Notice and take down policy:

Notice: Should you consider that our data contains material that is owned by you and should therefore not be reproduced here, please:

Clearly identify yourself, with detailed contact data such as an address, telephone number or email address at which you can be contacted.

Clearly identify the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed.

Clearly identify the material that is claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material.

And contact the authors.

Take down: We will comply to legitimate requests by removing the affected sources from the next release of the annotations.
